I am Zaky Hermawan, final year Electrical Engineering student at Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia. I am participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program this summer. I am contributing to GNU Radio project.

I will be working on GRC: Standalone application and pluggable workflows, mentored by Håkon Vågsether and Sebastian Koslowski. My work mainly revolves around code generation, and I may also touch on some aspects of the GUI part of GRC. The main goal of this project is to let people to define their own by making their own workflow file, template file, and code generator class. This project will last for 12 weeks.

Currently I have finished the option block modularization, and already make an attempt on workflow separation. Actually, it already works, but i will make some improvements on the workflow separation, so it will be more modular.
